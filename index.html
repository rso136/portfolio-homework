 		<p>Richard was raised in the small, suburban town of Newtown, Pennsylvania whose claim to fame is that it was the location of the sci-fi / horror film, <i>Signs</i>. He went off to Penn State, graduated with a degree in English, enrolled into seminary, and fulfilled his dream of becoming an ordained minister.</p>

 		<p>After meeting and marrying his lovely wife, Inyoung, Richard decided to shift gears and embark into the exciting and rapidly developing industry of web development. That's when he went knocking on the door of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp located in Somerset, New Jersey and was graciously ushered into the wonderful world of coding!</p>

 		<p>Aside from coding, Richard enjoys jamming on the electric guitar, playing video games, and following Major League Soccer as an avid New York City FC fan.</p>

 		<p>Richard hopes to make web development a life-long career and he is thrilled to have a chance to participate in the industry!</p>
